# Introduction
This package provides control object primitives for a ethercat bus of motor controllers, presently only the Maxon 
EPOS4 Micro. It wraps the `pysoem` library, providing a framework for interacting with device states and registers 
and performing homing (calibration) and position-based moves with devices on the bus. As a soft master, it requires a
dedicated NIC attached via ethernet cable to an EtherCAT motion controller bus. Note that EtherCAT traffic is 
incompatible with normal ethernet networks and networking equipment.

# Quick Start
- Instantiate `bus = EPOS4Bus(<ethernet device, i.e. eth0>>)`
- Subclass `EPOS4Motor` and implement `config_func`.
- Call `bus.initialize(type_mapping)`. Where type mapping is a mapping of bus node ID to `EPOS4Motor` subclass.
- Use methods on bus or bus.slaves. Refer to code/docstrings for more information. 

# Architecture
## EthercatBus
The hardware abstraction layer is responsible for sending actual information over the NIC to the workers. Currently, 
the only HAL setup for this repository is the [`pysoemHAL`](src/HAL/pysoem/ethercat_bus.py). It uses [pysoem](https://github.com/bnjmnp/pysoem), a cython wrapper for
[SOEM](https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM). Something to keep in mind is that these are designed to be *simple* soft EtherCAT controllers, 
and as a result it is difficult to directly change the CoE messages being sent, which likely prevents using 
CoE to its full potential. Future HALs should be made with the same function names and send the same CoE 
telegrams (this can be verified with wireshark). An additional consequence is that the high level soft 
controller and [`pysoemHAL`](src/HAL/pysoem/ethercat_bus.py) have very similar function names.

## EPOS4Bus
TODO this should likely be merged with the EthercatBus.

The high level controller breaks down many high level fundamental requests into sequences of CoE commands 
that will be performed by the hardware abstraction layer (HAL). This includes configuration tasks on startup. 
Additionally, it does a lot of 'book keeping' tasks, such as tracking worker process data object assignments, 
fully automates device state changes, and handling the network management state at the current scope of the 
project (it's easy to break with the addition of new features). 

A current limitation of the soft high level controller is that PDO communication is only possible once all workers 
have reached identical states and modes. The reason for this is that many of the performable actions (homing, 
and moving) complete at unique times for each worker, and all workers must receive PDO during each message. 
This means that creating a truly generalized PDO solution must handle time sensitive input, sequence sensitive 
input, and wait/continue logic unique to physical robotic systems. The difficulty of this task in comparison to 
the new capabilities was too low to justify for the FCS and CSU for which this repository was initially designed.


## EPOS4Motor
A base class for EPOS4 Micro's on the bus. Client code should subclass this and implement `config_func`. Look at the 
`lris2-csu` library for an example.

## Registers (helpers.py & epos4registers.py)


# Notes
- Software tested on [EPOS4 Micro 24/5 EtherCAT](https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/654731)
- Pesent development has centered on the needs of the LRIS2 CSU, the first client to this library.
  - This system uses EPOS2 Micro motion controllers and the CiA 402 specification.
- Currently the only CiA 402 supported operation modes are Homing Mode and Profile Position Mode (non-continuous)

## CiA 402 Specification  
The CAN in Automation (CiA) group has released a technical specification for power drive systems that is designed to 
make communication robust and safe. The most important thing to know about this specification is that it ensures 
robust and safe operation by standardizing device states, network management states, and operating modes. 
Certain actions, for example movement and configuration, are only available in the correct combination of 
device state, network management state, and operating mode. [A CoE CiA 402 guide](https://caltech.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/coo/LRIS-2/Shared%20Documents/LRIS-2%20-%20Subsystems%20%5BL3%5D/Maxon%20motion%20control/EPOS4%20Micro%2024%205%20EtherCAT%20Quick%20Start%20with%20Merged%20and%20Condensed%20Maxon%20Documentation.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=m6LDQB) has been made specifically 
for Maxon's EPOS Micro 24/5 EtherCAT worker hardware, which is worth a read to get more information 
about the CiA 402 specification.
